# Weekly Subscription Retention Cohorts Analysis
## Introduction
This project aims to conduct a comprehensive cohorts analysis on weekly subscription data. We'll be examining the number of subscribers who initiated their subscription in a specific week, then tracking their activity over the subsequent six weeks. By doing so, we'll gain valuable insights into subscriber retention patterns, which could potentially inform future business strategies.

The end result is a detailed visualization of weekly retention cohorts, starting from each week in our dataset and tracking user retention from week 0 through week 6. Please note that this analysis is based on the dataset as of 2021-02-07.
